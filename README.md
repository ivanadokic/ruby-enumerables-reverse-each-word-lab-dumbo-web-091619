# Reverse Each Word
def reverse_each_word(sentence)
  reversed = sentence.split(" ").collect do |word|
  word.reverse
end
  reversed.join(" ")
end

def reverse_each_word(string)
  array = string.split(" ") #turn string into an array
  test_array = []
  array.collect do|string| #iterate over the array
    test_array << string.reverse #reverse each word in the array
  end
  test_array.join(" ")
end

## Learning Goals

- Understand the return value of the each method
- Use the .collect method
- Understand the return value of the .collect method
- Use the return of collect for further operation

## Instructions

Write a method called `reverse_each_word` that takes in a string argument of a
sentence and returns that same sentence with each word reversed in place.

First solve it using `.each` Then utilize the same method using `.collect` to
see the difference.

For example:

```ruby
reverse_each_word("Hello there, and how are you?")
  #=> "olleH ,ereht dna woh era ?uoy"
```

**Hint:** *You can't use an enumerator on a string, so how can we turn our string into an array?*

**Hint:** *How can we reverse each word and return those altered words? Remember that* `.each` *returns the original array but other enumerators don't.*
